- sprawl development of Karad city
- temporal data source
- high resolution recent data
- RS and GIS layer outputs.

### KARAD Details

Karad is an ancient town situated on the confluence of the two sacred rivers, Krishna and Koyana. The confluence is better known as Preeti sangam, which is unique in nature.

Karad town lies between 17°17’ North latitude and 74°16’east longitude. According to census of 2001, the population of Karad city is 56149.

The town is 670.73meters above mean sea level

### RS and GIS data tools

1. high resolution Cartosat-1 data
2. IRS-1D, LISS-III

Satellites and sensors of data

1) IRS-1D LISS-3          P-95            R-60

IRS-P5 (Cartosat-1), launched on May 5, 2005, catapulted the Indian Remote Sensing program into the world of large scale mapping and terrain modeling applications.

The LISS-III, PAN and WiFS sensors on IRS-1C (December 1995) and IRS-1D (September 1997) ,application areas like resources survey and management, urban planning, forest studies, disaster monitoring and environmental studies.

### FLYOVER PROPOSAL KARAD

The flyover  starts at Cottage hospital Chowk and ends with Karmaveer Patil Chowk.

The two-lane both way flyover passing through the Vijay Chowk and Stand area.

Description in Brief:
Location – On the Krishna naka to Kolhapur naka road from Cottage hospital Chowk to Karmaveer Patil Chowk

The total length of flyover is 587m.
The Clear height at the Vijay Chowk is 5.5m.
The clear height at front of Stand is 4.5m and at front of Town hall is 5m.

The total width of road at Vijay Chowk to Krishna naka is 30m and to Datta Chowk are 20m. The proposed flyover is of 10m. It is of both ways. It situated at the center of the existing road. Hence there is single lane road on either side, which  carries one-way traffic. The flyover has each lane of 3.96m. The lanes are separated with the 80mm divider. The flyover has 0.5m wide parapet and 0.5m wide footpaths on both sides.
The main abutment is at the Vijay Chowk. The piers are on either side of the Vijay Chowk. The piers are at 20m distances apart. Total number of piers is seventeen. The girder used is of prestressed type. The RCC slab of 250mm is provided. The height of substructure is varying with the gradient. The height of superstructure is 1.3m. The height of parapet above slab is 1.05m.  

### ILWIS CONCLUSION REMARKS

- only tool for synoptic view is remote sensing data
- high-resolution data (Cartsosat-1)
- standard FCC of IRS -1D LISS III
- ILWIS was found to be very effective in getting fast, accurate and reliable data output for urban planning
- Using RS and GIS with software’s, traffic model can be formulated
- Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) data can be used for mapping the flood inundation area and the transportation network along side the riverbank can be modified accordingly.
